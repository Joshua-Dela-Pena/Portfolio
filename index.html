<div class="Paragraph"><div id="Home"><div id="About Me"></div><h1 class="stuff">About Me</h1><p class='words'> My name is Joshua Dela Pena and I'm 20 years old. I graduated from high-school in the year of 2020 ever since I graduated I've taken time off from further education pursuits 
        to take my life slow and really decide on who and what I want to become in the future. Coming into the next year 2021 my family members became a lot more pushy and wondered where
        I want to go with my life so I thought about it and with the good help of my brother-in-law I found interest in coding. Being born in the Philippines where college or further pursuit of education
        is fairly rare to be obtained coming into the US where education is a must it was a challenge to keep up to standards and really find what I'm passionate about. I started going to school at devCodeCamp on November 1st of 2021 
        and although I end up finding myself confused and overcomplicating things I work hard to really understand what wasn't understood and properly implement what I have to implement as I've always been slow on learning this is 
        particularly harder than most things that I learned in the past but I definitely think with an honest heart say that choosing to be a part of this program was not a mistake.
